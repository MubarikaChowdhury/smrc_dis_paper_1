# Introduction

Multiple linear regression maps the relationship between two or more predictors and dependent variable to a linear equation. The aim is to predict the response variable uisng the indepnedent variables. If X is a n×p full rank matrix of predictors and Y is a n × 1 vector of response variables the multiple linear regression can be explained as,

$$Y = X \times \beta + \epsilon$$,
where, $\beta$ is an p × 1 unknown regression paramaters and $\epsilon$ is the n × 1 vector of error with mean zero and equal variance.

One of the key assumption of the widely used multiple linear regression model is that the predictors need to be independent of each other. Violating the assumption of independence results in an issue known as multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It causes standard error of the coefficient to increase resulting in wide confidence interval and less reliable results. Identifying significant predictors also becomes difficult.
